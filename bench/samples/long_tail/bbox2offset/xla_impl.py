    Inverse transform that computes target bounding-box regression deltas
    given proposal boxes and ground-truth boxes. The weights argument should be
    a 4-tuple of multiplicative weights that are applied to the regression
    target.

    In older versions of this code (and in py-faster-rcnn), the weights were
    set such that the regression deltas would have unit standard deviation on
    the training dataset. Presently, rather than computing these statistics
    exactly, we use a fixed set of weights (10., 10., 5., 5.) by default.
    These are approximately the weights one would get from COCO using the
    previous unit stdev heuristic.
