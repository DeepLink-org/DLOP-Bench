    """Associative Embedding Loss in one image.

    Associative Embedding Loss including two parts: pull loss and push loss.
    Pull loss makes embedding vectors from same object closer to each other.
    Push loss distinguish embedding vector from different objects, and makes
        the gap between them is large enough.

    During computing, usually there are 3 cases:
        - no object in image: both pull loss and push loss will be 0.
        - one object in image: push loss will be 0 and pull loss is computed
            by the two corner of the only object.
        - more than one objects in image: pull loss is computed by corner pairs
            from each object, push loss is computed by each object with all
            other objects. We use confusion matrix with 0 in diagonal to
            compute the push loss.

    Args:
        tl_preds (tensor): Embedding feature map of left-top corner.
        br_preds (tensor): Embedding feature map of bottim-right corner.
        match (list): Downsampled coordinates pair of each ground truth box.
